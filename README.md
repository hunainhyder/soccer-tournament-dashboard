# Soccer Tournament Dashboard
I am making this project for my hiring process

## Goal to Achieve
### Problem statement is:
> Assume that soccer knockout league is being played. Now it should have information about the teams, team players and the grounds the match is being played at.<br/> Now the scheduling of matches between the teams in their respective grounds has to be visualized.

### Goals:

- Make a Dashboard containing:
    - individual players' performance (including their stats)
    - teams performance 
    - upcoming matches.

- Visualize the match scheduling. ( including match progress )
- Visualize team setup
- Detailed scorecard of each match. 
	eg: 
	-	how many goals did the goal keeper save.
	-	which player scored the highest
	-	which player had most assists
	-	which player had the best defence
